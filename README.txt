In this project, I design a simple cache system to achieve basic cache functionality. The cache system includes a cache module, memory module, data buffer, address buffer and processor module.

The project is implemented in Verilog HDL language, and compiled and simulated in Mentor Graphics design software ModelSim 10.0c version.
